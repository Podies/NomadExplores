					<h3>What is the duration of the program?</h3>
					<p>Remote Explorers Batch 1 will commence on September 15 till October 15.</p>

					<h3>How to reach McLeodganj?</h3>
					<p>Delhi is the most convenient starting point to reach McLeodganj irrespective of where in India you start your journey from. Unless, of course, if you are up north already.</p>
					<p>To make it easy for you, we are arranging for a pickup from Delhi on 14th September to take you to the Remote Explorers venue by overnight bus/train. Please let us know if you are planning to reach earlier/later than 14th in Delhi and we will be happy to give you directions. </p>

					<!--<p style="margin-top:10px;"><b>By bus:</b> There are a few overnight buses running from Delhi ISBT till Dharamsala. You can book them through <a href="https://www.redbus.in/" target="_blank">www.redbus.in.</a> If you find any difficulty in doing so, we will be happy to help you with the bookings. A ticket for a semi-sleeper AC Volvo bus costs about 1100 Rupees (17 USD). Our program manager will be present at the Dharamsala bus station to help you.</p>
					<p style="margin-top:10px;"><b>By train:</b> Numerous overnight trains (approx. 8 hours) run from different train stations in Delhi till Pathankot, which is 120 kilometers from Dharamsala. Upon reaching Pathankot, you can take a local bus (120 rupees~ 2 USD) to reach Dharamsala. Our program manager will be present at the Dharamsala bus station to help you. AC Sleeper trains should cost ~20 USD.</p>
					<p style="margin-top:10px;"><b>Flight:</b> There are three daily flights between Delhi and Dharamsala. However, flying is considerably expensive at about 80 USD.</p> -->

					<h3>Are flights from/to my home country included in the price?</h3>
					<p>No. However, we are partnering with <a href="www.flystein.com">Flystein</a> to get you some handsome savings on your flight bookings. Flystein will offer 15% discount to Remote Explorers participants.</p>

					<h3>Getting an Indian Visa is difficult, isn’t it?</h3>
					<p>Not anymore. Citizen of 161 countries can now get eVisa for 2 months. All you need to do is to apply on <a href="https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html" target="_blank">https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html</a> and follow the instructions.</p>

					<h3>I want to come to India earlier, where can I go before Remote Explorers S1E1?</h3>
					<p>August/ Early September is the best time to visit Ladakh, Lahaul and Spiti. These are some of the most scenic and unspoilt areas in India. Being remote, the internet could be an issue though. You can also visit Rajasthan in August and continue to Agra to see Tajmahal on your way up.</p>

					<h3>I want to explore more of India after the retreat, where should I go?</h3>
					<p>October/November opens up a lot more possibilities to travel around India as monsoons recede early September. Kerala is a great destination during this time as you can see lush greenery all around. And yes, you can also go to Goa if you are in a mood for a party. Let’s talk more about your plans and we would be happy to help you!</p>
					
					<h3>What should I pack with me?</h3>
					<p>Since the retreat is happening in the mountains, a light jacket or sweater is recommended. Shoes with good grip are recommended for trekking and other adventure activities. You can buy everything cheap in the market at McLeodganj though. Also, carry an international power adapter as the sockets may differ from your home country.</p>
					
					<h3>How about internet and power?</h3>
					<p>Since we are digital nomads ourselves, we know your needs. We are arranging for a fast and reliable internet with an emergency backup line to make sure these issues don’t impede your work. We are also arranging for a dedicated power backup for contingencies.</p>

					<h3>What sort of accommodation is available?</h3>
					<p>We have two options. Single and Twin-sharing rooms. We have ensured that all the rooms are clean and comfortable.</p>

					<h3>What about the workspace?</h3>
					<p>We are setting up a temporary rooftop workspace in the same building. We will provide fast and reliable internet, power backup, comfortable chairs, power sockets etc.</p>

					<h3>What about the weather?</h3>
					<p>Monsoons recede by early September, giving way to clearer skies and pleasant weather. This is the best time to enjoy the views of lush green foothills and treks in the lower Himalayas.</p>

					<h3>Do you have any plans to arrange for retreats in Goa and other parts of India?</h3>
					<p>Certainly! We are tentatively looking at arranging a digital nomad retreat in Goa in February 2018. We are also looking at some other places and pretty excited about arranging retreats there as well.</p>

					<h3>What is the selection process?</h3>
					<p>We will screen each of the applications carefully to make sure each participant adds value to the group. We will also arrange for telecon with applicants before we make a decision.</p>

					<!--
					<h3>What basis will you filter applicants on?</h3>
					<p>As our core philosophy suggests, our focus is on exploration, learning, and getting things done. We will primarily evaluate applicants on the basis of that.</p> -->
